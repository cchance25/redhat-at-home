# Red Hat at Home

This repository is meant to house a collection of Ansible Playbooks, Bash scripts, and other assets to support deploying Red Hat products in a home lab environment.  While it is targeted to home labs, these deployment mechanisms can be used in a number of other scenarios.

- **[Bash]** Red Hat Satellite
  Deploy Red Hat Satellite entirely in an automated fashion.  Additional helper scripts and command references for additional functions such as custom Products, RHV/VMWare integration, and more.
- **[Ansible][WIP]** Create VM from Template in VMWare vSphere
  Take an existing template from your VMWare environment and create a new VM from it
- **[Ansible][WIP]** Create CentOS VM in Red Hat Virtualization
